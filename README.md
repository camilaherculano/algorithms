# bfs.cpp

# Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of nodes in the tree. 
Next line contains n space separated integer where ith integer denotes node[i].data.
 
Remember that in a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value, and all values on the right branch are greater than the node value. 

# Output Format

The bfs function prints a single line with n integers denoting the node order in a bfs(breadth-first search) of the binary tree.

# Sample Input

5 8 3 4 2 1 9

# Sample Output
5 3 8 2 4 9 1
